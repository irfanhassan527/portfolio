I am **Irfan Hassan**, a Master’s student in Computer Science and Technology at Southwest Jiaotong University, China.  
My research focuses on **multimodal object detection in remote sensing** and deep learning for computer vision.

I previously completed my BSc in Information Technology at the University of Education, Lahore, Pakistan.  
I also worked as an AI Engineer at MUX Institute, where I developed Python-based automation and data-driven solutions.

I am particularly interested in:
- Multimodal remote sensing (RGB, thermal, etc.)
- Object detection models for UAV and satellite imagery
- Efficient deep learning architectures for real-world applications
